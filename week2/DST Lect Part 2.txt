Increase the delay of a lowpass filter to get a comb filter. 


Quantization - Number of bits used to represent a given sample. Our ears can sense music even in low quantization levels - an important piece of useful info 

Dithering - add little bit of noise to mask harmonic noise artifacts, making them more 'inaudible'

Equal power panning (vs. normal panning?) actually employs a logarithmic increase/decrease of power in each channel to get a smooth panning.

Roland SC55

Compressor - Polyfin to model the compressor function

Chebyshev Polynomials and Waveshaping

Chorus - A delay where the delay period is a function of something, so delayed signal comes in with various amounts of delay, giving the illusion of natural imperfections
